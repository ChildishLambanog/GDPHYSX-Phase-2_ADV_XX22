//This implementation simulates a bungee by letting the particle to move freely and adds no force if the particle
//is within the bungee's rest length. But if the particle is beyond the bungee's rest length it applies a restoring force.
//The restoring force applied is a spring like force that pulls the particle towards the anchor point. The stretch is the 
//computation of how much the particle is beyond the bungee's rest length which is then multiplied to spring constant to 
//get the restoring force.
